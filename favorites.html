                Dracula or better known as Count Dracula was a mythical being known for sucking blood - or as Bram Stoker describes him;
                <strong><em>a bloodthirsty demon - </em></strong>
                from his victims using his sharp protruding cannatial teeth.<br>

                Anyway, it was an act which as read from Bram Stoker's novel: <em>Dracula</em>, rejuvanated 
                the Count and in some sort of way, got him back to a younger, more muscular body - Not that he wasn't in his 
                <q>1000 years</q> or so old body -.
